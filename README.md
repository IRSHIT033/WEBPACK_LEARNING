# What is WEBPACK ?

<p>webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.</p>

## Before WEBPACK
<p> We saw that there are lots of new libraries and frameworks introduced. So Websites before were bulky with all of the javascript modules.So all of this lead to Complex and larger code base. But there was a problem Developers had to write " polyfills " ( a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.)
To fix these issues webpack was created.</p>

## After WEBPACK
 <p> Webpack goes through your package and creates A dependency graph which consists of various modules which your webapp would require to function as expected.Then it creates a new package which consists of very bare minimum of files required, a single bundle.js file.</p>
